In this project I used census data to predict an individuals income level.  I used random forest as my model since it had to handle categorical data. I chose to leave out some features, including sex because it made the model less accurate.  This project produced an accurace of 0.80. It had difficulties predicting incomes less than 50k which I would like to improve in the future.
